<h2>How to mix and melt and make your own lip balm</h2>
 <br> <p>Ingredients: Beeswax, Coconut oil, honey, vitamin e capsules, essential oil.
Why Beeswax: Beeswax can act as an emollient moisturizer as well as protect your lips from the elements, but the most important role it plays is that it is what gives your lip balm its stiffness and body so that it can be easily transported and applied.</p></div>

<h2>TIPS </h2> 

<p>Why coconut oil: Coconut oil will not coat and smother your skin like petroleum based products, and moisturizes deep down. Its fatty acids hold onto moisture, and can help reinforce the skins lipid fat layer, which promoted hydration.

Why honey: Honey is a natural humectant, which means it attracts and holds onto water molecules.</p>
