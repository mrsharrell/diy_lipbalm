<p>Lips are extremely susceptible to drying out-much more so than 
other parts of our body, as they are always exposed to the elements, 
and really have only a thin layer of skin to protect them. This is why 
we turn to lip balm. By now you are probably heard that lip balm dries 
your lips out, which in turn makes you apply more, and then it turns into 
an addicting habit that is not doing you, or your lips, any favors. That is, 
to some extent, true. Certain lip balms do contain ingredients that feel good 
at first, but leave you with the need to put more on just an hour or 2 later as
they dry up, and leave your skin even drier. They also act by creating a barrier 
than just sits on top of your skin, and locks out any moisture it might be getting from the air.</p>

     <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeswax><h2>Beeswax</h2></a>

<p>Beeswax (Cera alba) is a natural wax produced by honey bees of the genus Apis. The wax is formed into "scales" by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of worker bees, who discard it in or at the hive. The hive workers collect and use it to form cells for honey-storage and larval and pupal protection within the beehive. Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of esters of fatty acids and various long-chain alcohols.

Beeswax has long-standing applications in human food and flavoring. For example, it is used as a glazing agent, a sweetener, or as a light/heat source. It is edible, in the sense of having similar negligible toxicity to plant waxes, and is approved for food use in most countries and the European Union under the E number E901. However, the wax monoesters in beeswax are poorly hydrolysed in the guts of humans and other mammals, so they have insignificant nutritional value.Some birds, such as honeyguides, can digest beeswax. Beeswax is the main diet of Wax moth larvae.</p>

<p>Coconut oil, or copra oil, is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of mature coconuts harvested from the coconut palm. It has various applications. Because of its high saturated fat content, it is slow to oxidize and, thus, resistant to rancidification, lasting up to six months at 24 degrees without spoiling.

Due to its high levels of saturated fat, the World Health Organization, United States Food and Drug Administration, International College of Nutrition, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, British National Health Service, British Nutrition Foundation and Dietitians of Canada advise that coconut oil consumption should be limited or avoided.</p>
